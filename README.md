# MyList

A Simple list marker/modifier using numbers and functions to sort, search using binary search, insert to the list, and display the list.

## Build
Build the program with g++ or gcc. Once you run it, there will be a display of instructions to follow.

Note: For command sort, it will sort the numbers that are in a list. Once it is sorted it will keep the list sorted until the command
unsort is given. When the command unsort is given, the list will stay the same but new numbers entered will no longer be automatically sorted.
